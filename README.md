# Masters Research Project 
## Data Center Energy Management @ ENEA Portici Research Center, Italy
## Awarded best Master Thesis Award :trophy: at 6th IFAC Symposium and Telematics (Nancy, France)

* Introduction
  ------------

This project is Master thesis research conducted at ENEA Portici Research Center. The data is obtained from the HPC CRESCO6 cluster at ENEA Portici Research Center. The aim is to identify energy consuming areas within the data center. In this project, real-time dataset from ENEA Portici Research Center is used. Since the research is in collaboration with the organization, the dataset cannot be shared publicly as it is against the organizationâ€™s policy. There are several techniques implemented including big data analytics and AI technology. The research is divided into 4 phases. 

1.	First phase provides exploratory data analysis of dataset which involves data collection, data transformation, descriptive analysis and inferential statistical analysis. Since, the data cannot be made publicly available, the experiments for this phase are not provided. 

2.	Second phase analysis the thermal characteristics of the IT room in data center. Machine learning classification is used to identify the thermal conditions of the IT room. 

3.	Third phase uses deep learning modelling for advance prediction of resource utilization which includes CPU, memory and network utilization. 

4.	Forth phase future forecast the active energy consumption and energy waste by jobs execution in the data center.

The methodology can be implemented on different datasets of other data centers. 

* Requirements
  ------------
1.	The provided codes works in all python versions above 3.7.0. 

2.	The dataset used in this project was quite large, So Google Colab Pro is used. Otherwise any Python IDEs can be used.


* Installation
  ------------
There are few python packages and libraries that need to be installed which are provided in the python codes.
